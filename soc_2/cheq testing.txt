Commitment to our Customers 
Your compliance and security needs are our priority.
At CHEQ, we take great care in implementing and maintaining the security of our services 
and your data. We employ industry standard procedures and policies to ensure the safety 
of your data and prevent unauthorized use of any such information.
Your Information is Secure
ISO 27001 and SOC2.
CHEQ is ISO 27001certified. We are 
targeting SOC 2 compliance to be 
certified in Q3 2022.
Your Privacy Practice is Protected
CHEQ abides by GDPR, CCPA and related regulations.
None of the CHEQ products require access to information that directly identifies end 
users accessing your site. CHEQ is a ‘Processor’ under the GDPR and a ‘Service Provider’ 
under the CCPA. In its capacity as such, CHEQ processes personal data it collects only as 
necessary to provide its services to the applicable CHEQ customer who authorized the 
collection of such data. 
Data access and storage.
CHEQ ensures all data is stored, 
processed and hosted on SOC2 
compliant AWS data centers.
Your Customer’s Site Experience is Unaltered
CHEQ’s Asynchronous Tags don’t affect site performance.
The CHEQ JavaScript tag is designed to be a seamless addition to your website, adding 
no latency or discernable impact on the user experience. As an asynchronous tag that 
loads in parallel to your website, it does not block or delay the rendering of the page.
