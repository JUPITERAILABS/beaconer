# Latest Changes

## Question matching
- As discussed with Anita and Himanshu in the earlier calls, we have hard coded the response for the demo
- We are using Beaconer Siglight Report as our basis (base template file) for matching questions of input files
- Using the base template file to get answers written in the input file
- your demo of changing an answer/response in the input file and getting results reflected on the output file is working now

## Report Generation
- The report you sent has a lot of elements that seem to be out of scope for now
- We've created the tables inside the report that was shared to populate
- there are diagrams and info graphics which we see are dependent upon the generated report, however those are not in scope to be generated from backend as of now.
